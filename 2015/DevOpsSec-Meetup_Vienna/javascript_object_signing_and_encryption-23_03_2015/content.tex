  \begin{theorem}
    There is no largest prime number.
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
    \begin{enumerate}
      % The strange way of typesetting math is to minimize font usage
      % in order to keep the file sizes of the examples small.
    \item<1-| alert@1> Suppose $p$ were the largest prime number.
    \item<2-> Let $q$ be the product of the first $p$ numbers.
    \item<3-> Then $q$\;+\,$1$ is not divisible by any of them.
    \item<1-> Thus $q$\;+\,$1$ is also prime and greater than $p$.\qedhere
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{proof}
